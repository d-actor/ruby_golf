# Create a method that takes in 2 strings and counts the total number of characters in common. 
# Divide the total number of chars by the number in common. Spaces do not count. 
# Capitols are not the same as lowercase 
# Example: "I love this code", "This code loves me" Total Chars: 27 Chars In Common: 7 Solution: 27 / 7 = 3
